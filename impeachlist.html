              <p>In his conduct while President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution "to take care that the laws be faithfully executed," has obstructed justice.<br>
                <br>
                The day after President Trump was briefed by White House Counsel on dishonest statements by then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn who was being investigated by the FBI, Trump met with the director of the FBI James Comey and demanded his personal loyalty. Two weeks later Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation. Later still, Trump fired Comey. By Trump's own words <a class="text-primary" href="http://nbcnews.to/2s0iLJq" target="_blank">(Link)</a>, his motivation was at least partly to obstruct the investigation.<br>
                <br>
                By this action, President Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President, and subversive of constitutional government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States and the world. Wherefore, President Donald J. Trump, by such conduct, is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from office. <br><br><b class="text-primary"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></b></p>

              <p>In his conduct while President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” has illegally received emoluments from foreign governments. Foreign emoluments are banned by the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 9).<br>
                <br>
                Donald J. Trump’s business has licensing deals with two Trump Towers in Istanbul, Turkey. Donald J. Trump has stated: “I have a little conflict of interest, because I have a major, major building in Istanbul.”<br>
                <br>
                China’s state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the largest tenant in Trump Tower in New York City. It is also a major lender to the Trump organization. Its rent payments and its loans put President Trump in violation of the U.S. Constitution.<br>
                <br>
                Foreign diplomats, including the Embassy of Kuwait, have changed their Washington D.C. hotel and event reservations to Trump International Hotel following Donald J. Trump’s election to public office.<br>
                <br>
                In these and many similar actions and decisions, President Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President, and subversive of constitutional government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.

              <p>In his conduct while President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” has illegally received emoluments from the United States government and from individual state governments.<br>
                <br>
                The Constitutional ban on domestic emoluments (Article II, Section 1) is absolute, not waivable by Congress, and not subject to proving any particular corrupting influence.<br>
                <br>
                President Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office Building in Washington D.C. violates the General Services Administration lease contract which states: “No … elected official of the Government of the United States … shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.” The GSA’s failure to enforce that contract constitutes an emolument. A January 16, 2019, <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.gsaig.gov/sites/default/files/ipa-reports/JE19-002%20OIG%20EVALUATION%20REPORT-GSA's%20Management%20&%20Administration%20of%20OPO%20Building%20Lease_January%2016%202019_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank">report by the Inspector General of the General Services Administration</a> confirmed this.<br>
                <br>
                Since 1980 Trump and his businesses have garnered, according to the New York Times, “$885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York.” Those subsidies from the state of New York have continued since President Trump took office and constitute emoluments. The Trump organization receives emoluments from other states as well.<br>
                <br>
                In these and many similar actions and decisions, President Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President, and subversive of constitutional government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.

              <p>In his conduct while President of the United States, and while campaigning for election to that office, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” has illegally incited violence within the United States.<br>
                <br>
                A partial sampling of public statements by candidate Donald J. Trump:
                “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them. I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.”<br>
                <br>
                “You know what I hate? There’s a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches, we’re not allowed to punch back anymore. I love the old days—you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They’d be carried out on a stretcher, folks.”<br>
                <br>
                “See the first group, I was nice. Oh, take your time. The second group, I was pretty nice. The third group, I’ll be a little more violent. And the fourth group, I’ll say get the hell out of here!”<br>
                <br>
                “I’d like to punch him in the face, I tell ya.”<br>
                <br>
                “He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back. That’s what we need more of.”<br>
                <br>
                Numerous incidents of violence followed these and other similar comments. John Franklin McGraw punched a man in the face at a Trump event, and then told Inside Edition that “The next time we see him, we might have to kill him.” Donald J. Trump said that he was considering paying McGraw’s legal bills.<br>
                <br>
                Since Trump’s election and inauguration, his comments appearing to incite violence have continued, as have incidents of violence in which those participating in violence have pointed to Trump as justification.<br>
                <br>
                On July 2, 2017, President Donald J. Trump tweeted a video of himself body slamming a man with an image of “CNN” superimposed on him.<br>
                <br>
                In August 2017, participants in a racist rally in Charlottesville, Va., credited President Trump with boosting their cause. Their violence included actions that led to a murder charge. President Trump publicly minimized the offense and sought to blame “many sides.”
                In April 2019, weeks after one of his supporters was arrested by the FBI for threatening to shoot Congresswoman Ilhan Omar in the head, President Trump tweeted a misleading and inflammatory video promoting just the sort of hatred toward Omar that the man arrested had expressed.<br>
                <br>
                In these and similar actions and decisions, President Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President, and subversive of constitutional government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.

              <p>In his conduct while President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” has repeatedly undermined the freedom of the press.<br>
                <br>
                President Trump has threatened to use libel law to go after media outlets that have displeased him. On March 30, 2017, he <a class="text-primary" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/847455180912181249" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: “The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world. Gotten me wrong for two solid years. Change libel laws?” On April 30, 2017, his then chief of staff Reince Priebus <a class="text-primary" href="http://cnnmon.ie/2qildKS" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that changing libel laws is “something we’ve looked at,” adding that “newspapers and news agencies need to be more responsible with how they report the news.” On July 2, 2017, President Donald J. Trump <a class="text-primary" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/881503147168071680" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a video of himself body slamming a man with an image of “CNN” superimposed on him.<br>
                <br>
                President Trump has threatened to remove broadcasting licenses from media outlets that have displeased him. On October 11, 2017, he <a class="text-primary" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918112884630093825" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: ‘‘With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!’’ and ‘‘Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!’’<br>
                <br>
                President Trump's White House, on February 24, 2017, <a class="text-primary" href="http://wapo.st/2lE6R2t" target="_blank">barred</a> certain news media — CNN, the New York Times, the L.A. Times, and Politico — from attending a White House press briefing. In June 2017, his administration <a class="text-primary" href="http://cnnmon.ie/2s0g8sd" target="_blank">prohibited</a> video recordings of White House press briefings. In November 2018, his administration <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2018/nov/08/white-house-accuses-cnns-jim-acosta-of-placing-his-hands-on-young-intern-video" target="_blank">suspended</a> the press credential of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, falsely accusing him of “placing his hands” on a white house intern.<br>
                <br>
                President Trump has repeatedly referred to news media as “the enemy of the people,” while expressing his desire that journalistic activity be stifled.  For example: On February 17, 2017, <a class="text-primary" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065" target="_blank">Trump tweeted</a>: ‘‘The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!’’. On July 22, 2017, <a class="text-primary" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/888708453560184832" target="_blank">Trump tweeted</a>: “A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!”<br>
                <br>
                President Trump’s rhetoric has encouraged authoritarian foreign governments to attack the very U.S. media that Trump criticizes, endangering not only press freedoms but the lives and safety of American journalists. On May 2, 2017, just ahead of World Press Freedom Day, <a class="text-primary" href="https://cpj.org/x/6c96" target="_blank">the Committee to Protect Journalists noted</a> that “President Trump's oft-tweeted ‘fake news’ epithet, for example, had already been adopted by repressive governments such as China, Syria, and Russia. When Trump verbally attacked a correspondent during a February press conference, he was cheered by Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the world's worst jailer of journalists.<br>
                <br>
                When Saudi Arabia murdered U.S./Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/05/politics/trump-khashoggi-murder/index.html" target="_blank">President Trump made</a> extensive efforts to deny the evidence and to prevent or minimize the consequences to the Saudi government, even while continuing his usual verbal attacks on U.S. journalists.<br>
                <br>
                President <a class="text-primary" href="https://rightsanddissent.org/news/defending-rights-dissent-expresses-concern-about-journalist-detained-as-material-witness/" target="_blank">Trump's subordinates locked up</a> U.S./Iranian journalist Marzieh Hashemi with no charges or trial as a "material witness."<br>
                <br>
                President Trump's Department of Justice has <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/julian-assange-indictment-wikileaks.html" target="_blank">indicted Australian publisher</a> Julian Assange on espionage charges for Wikileaks' acts of journalism and publishing.<br>
                <br>
                President Trump appointed William Barr as U.S. Attorney General; <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/01/15/william-barr-jailing-journalists-i-know-there-are-guidelines-place/?utm_term=.f1b6c3d9dd78" target="_blank">Barr stated</a> at his confirmation hearings that he might jail journalists for doing their job if that job "hurt the country."<br>
                <br>
                Freedom of the press is enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. As Justice Black observed in New York Times Co. v. United States, "In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government."<br>
                <br>
                A president is certainly free to criticize particular news stories and outlets that he believes are inaccurate — and no above-cited tweet or statement, standing in isolation, would constitute an impeachable offense. However, President Trump's consistent pattern of verbal attacks against journalists and his administration's actions to retaliate against and exclude journalists, combined with threats to take governmental action against news outlets, crosses a line.<br>

                In the above and many similar actions and decisions, President Donald J.

              <p>In his conduct while President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution "to take care that the laws be faithfully executed," has overseen the work of his subordinates who have forcibly separated thousands of refugee children and infants from their families, imprisoned them in inhumane conditions including on military bases and in the private facilities of military contractors, denied access to these sites sought by members of Congress, failed to meet or even to plausibly attempt to meet a court-imposed deadline to reunite children with their families, and defended these policies with hate-inspiring rhetoric almost certainly resulting in additional violence and cruelty by government employees and private individuals alike (see also Article of Impeachment on "Incitement of Violence").<br>
                <br>
                In these actions, Donald J. Trump has abused his high office and violated numerous legal requirements in an explicit effort to punish and deter people who in many cases stand accused of no legal violations themselves, and in other cases are accused of a misdemeanor. These actions by President Trump have violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to which the United States is party, the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which every other nation on earth is party, the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has maintained that "the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by [the] Court." President Trump's subsequent Executive Order stating that families would be imprisoned as groups, rather than being separated, would have failed to bring him into compliance with international law or the Constitution even if implemented.<br>

              <p>In his conduct while President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” has issued a pardon for former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, Joe Arpaio, who had been convicted of contempt for failure to comply with a court order in a case charging him with racial discrimination.<br>
                <br>
                Arpaio was open about his commission of the underlying crime, for which he was found liable in a civil suit. His contempt conviction was for continuing to engage in racial profiling, violating an order to cease doing so.<br>
                <br>
                Arpaio set up a prison that he called a concentration camp. It had a high death rate with deaths often unexplained. He enclosed Latino prisoners with electric fencing.<br>
                <br>
                According to Washington Post <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/take-the-land-president-trump-wants-a-border-wall-he-wants-it-black-and-he-wants-it-by-election-day/2019/08/27/37b80018-c821-11e9-a4f3-c081a126de70_story.html" target="_blank">reporting</a>, Trump has directed his subordinates to illegally seize private land and violate environmental regulations in order to build a wall on the Mexican border, and has promised to pardon all the crimes involved.<br>

                By this action, President Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President, and subversive of constitutional government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States and the world.

                <br>
                On July 27, 1974, the House Committee on the Judiciary adopted an <a class="text-primary" href="https://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment" target="_blank">article of impeachment</a> against then-President Richard M. Nixon accusing him of failing to comply with Congressional subpoenas. President Donald J. Trump has similarly refused to comply with subpoenas.<br>
                <br>
                Counsel to the President Pat A. Cipollone has written <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/08/us/politics/white-house-letter-impeachment.html" target="_blank">a letter</a> stating that President Trump will not comply with subpoenas related to impeachment investigations.

                <br>
                In so acting, President Trump has violated Article 1, Section 7 of the United States Constitution: "All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives . . . ." He has also, in so acting, violated Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution: "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . . . ." The same action also violates the Federal Anti-Deficiency Statute. By using the United States military to enforce immigration law, President Trump's announced plan would also violate the Posse Comitatus Act.<br>
                <br>
                In addition, President Trump has abused his power by publicly promoting this action using a series of falsehoods encouraging fear, bigotry, and hatred. He has falsely suggested that immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than non-immigrants, that illegal border crossings have been increasing in recent years, that terrorist groups have sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico, and that applying for asylum is a threatening or criminal action.<br>
                <br>
                In these and many similar actions and decisions, President Donald J.

                <br>
                On May 24, 2019, the Secretary of State announced this policy, justifying it as a means "to deter Iranian aggression." No evidence of Iranian aggression was offered, but President Trump and his subordinates had in the preceding days and weeks been engaged in actions that might provoke Iranian "aggression," including threatening attacks on Iran, moving troops and weapons to the region, declaring part of the Iranian military to be a terrorist organization, producing allegations against Iran widely doubted even by U.S. officials, and -- indeed -- providing weapons to Saudi Arabia.<br>
                <br>
                Congress had been blocking the sale of certain weapons to Saudi Arabia, and the clear purpose of declaring a false emergency was to subvert the will of Congress.<br>
                <br>
                In these actions and decisions, President Donald J.

Trump, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce witnesses, papers, and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 22, 2019, and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives on April 2, 2019. The subpoenaed witnesses, papers, and things were deemed necessary by the Committees in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to Presidential direction, knowledge, or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be potential grounds for impeachment of the President, including matters <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?459409-1/oversight-committee-subpoena-white-house-official-security-clearances" target="_blank">involving security clearances</a> and <a class="text-primary" href="https://themoscowproject.org/collusion/house-judiciary-subpoenas-mcgahn/" target="_blank">"Russiagate"</a>.<br>

                In refusing to produce these witnesses, papers, and things Donald J.

                <br>
                As documented in the July 2019 report by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, "Corporate and Foreign Interests Behind White House Push to Transfer U.S. Nuclear Technology to Saudi Arabia," under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act, approval of Congress is required to transfer nuclear technology to a foreign country. Congress has not given its approval to such transfers to Saudi Arabia, which has not committed to avoiding activities linked to proliferation, but has, on the contrary, publicly threatened to develop nuclear weapons. President Donald J. Trump has nonetheless made efforts on behalf of those who would profit financially to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.<br>
                <br>
                President Donald J. Trump has, moreover, completely refused to cooperate with the Congressional Committee investigation of this matter, and not produced a single document requested.<br>

              <p>In his conduct prior to assuming the office of President of the United States, Donald J. Trump engaged in extensive <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html" target="_blank">tax fraud</a> which served as the basis for his dramatic misrepresentation to the public of his accomplishments.<br>
                <br>
                According to evidence and documentation made public by the New York Times and not countered by President Trump, he and his siblings committed numerous felonies in the course of obtaining wealth from their father while paying approximately 5% rather than the 55% in taxes that the law required.<br>
                <br>
                They did this, in part, by undervaluing properties, a crime known as appraisal fraud. Donald Trump and his siblings claimed that properties given them by their father were worth $41.4 million, but sold those properties for over 16 times that amount during the next decade.<br>
                <br>
                Another crime employed was transfer pricing. Trump and his siblings massively overcharged their father's companies for largely nonexistent services in order to both obtain his wealth and reduce his profits. The reduction in profits allowed Trump's father to increase the rent he charged people for publicly subsidized, rent-controlled properties.<br>
                <br>
                Through these and other fraudulent activities, Donald Trump was made wealthy by the transfer of money from his father. In the analysis of one <a class="text-primary" href="https://rootsaction.org/news-a-views/1902--trump-probably-engaged-in-felony-tax-evasion" target="_blank">expert</a>, if Trump had simply invested that money in a simple investment fund, he would now have the $10 billion he falsely claimed to have as a candidate for president. In reality, Trump lost a fortune through business failures. As a candidate, however, by lying about his wealth and the origins of his wealth, Donald Trump misled voters to believe that, while he had no political record he did have a very successful business record. Trump falsely claimed to have received only $1 million from his father which he had been required to pay back "with interest."<br>

              <p>While campaigning for the office of President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, according to the sworn testimony and the guilty plea of his attorney Michael Cohen, engaged in a criminal conspiracy to buy the silence of individuals, and did so with the intent of influencing the election and in violation of campaign finance laws.<br>
                <br>
                On August 21, 2018, Cohen admitted in federal court that he had paid Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to silence them before the 2016 election at Donald J. Trump's "direction." Cohen said he acted "in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office" and "for the principal purpose of influencing the election." This testimony implicates Donald J. Trump in the crime of conspiring to make an excessive and illegal campaign contribution. It also implicates him in the high crime and misdemeanor of attempting to fraudulently influence -- and quite possibly successfully influence -- the outcome of a U.S. presidential election. As President, he lied about and tried to cover-up his wrongdoing.<br>
                <br>
                In this action, President Donald J.
